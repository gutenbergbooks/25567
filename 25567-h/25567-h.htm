<p>Over the cabin &rsquo;phone, Ann&rsquo;s voice was
crisp with anger. &ldquo;Mr. Lord, I must see you
at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Ann.&rdquo; Lord tried not to
sound uncordial. It was all part of a trade
agent&rsquo;s job, to listen to the
recommendations and complaints of the teacher. But
an interview with Ann Howard was always so
arduous, so stiff with unrelieved righteousness.
&ldquo;I should be free until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you come down to the schoolroom, Mr.
Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s necessary. But I told you
yesterday, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to make
them take the lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand your point of view, Mr.
Lord.&rdquo; Her words were barely civil, brittle
shafts of ice. &ldquo;However, this concerns Don;
he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone? Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jumped ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Ann? How long ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather imagined you&rsquo;d be
interested,&rdquo; she answered with smug
satisfaction. &ldquo;Naturally you&rsquo;ll want
to see his note. I&rsquo;ll be waiting for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &rsquo;phone clicked decisively as she broke
the connection. Impotent fury lashed Lord&rsquo;s
mind&mdash;anger at Don Howard, because the engineer
was one of his key men; and, childishly, anger at
Don&rsquo;s sister because she was the one who had
broken the news. If it had come from almost anyone
else it would, somehow, have seemed less
disastrous. Don&rsquo;s was the fourth desertion
in less than a week, and the loss of trained
personnel was becoming serious aboard the <i>Ceres</i>.
But what did Ann Howard expect Lord to do about
it? This was

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Page&nbsp;8]</a></span>

a trading ship; he had no military authority over his crew.</p>

<p>As Lord stood up, his desk chair collapsed with a
quiet hiss against the cabin wall, and, on greased
tubes, the desk dropped out of sight beneath the
bunk bed, giving Lord the luxury of an uncluttered
floor space eight feet square. He had the only
private quarters on the ship&mdash;the usual
distinction reserved for a trade agent in command.</p>

<p>From a narrow wardrobe, curved to fit the
projectile walls of the ship, Lord took a
lightweight jacket, marked with the tooled
shoulder insignia of command. He smiled a little
as he put it on. He was Martin Lord, trade agent
and heir to the fabulous industrial-trading empire
of Hamilton Lord, Inc.; yet he was afraid to face
Ann Howard without the visible trappings of
authority.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He descended the spiral stairway to the midship
airlock, a lead-walled chamber directly above the
long power tubes of the <i>Ceres</i>. The lock door
hung open, making an improvised landing porch
fifty feet above the charred ground. Lord paused
for a moment at the head of the runged landing
ladder. Below him, in the clearing where the ship
had come down, he saw the rows of plastic prefabs
which his crew had thrown up&mdash;laboratories,
sleeping quarters, a kitchen, and Ann
Howard&rsquo;s schoolroom.</p>

<p>Beyond the clearing was the edge of the
magnificent forest which covered so much of this
planet. Far away, in the foothills of a distant
mountain range, Lord saw the houses of a village,
gleaming in the scarlet blaze of the setting sun.
A world at peace, uncrowded, unscarred by the
feverish excavation and building of man. A world
at the zenith of its native culture, about to be
jerked awake by the rude din of civilization. Lord
felt a twinge of the same guilt that had tormented
his mind since the <i>Ceres</i> had first landed, and
with an effort he drove it from his mind.</p>

<p>He descended the ladder and crossed the clearing,
still blackened from the landing blast; he pushed
open the sliding door of the schoolroom. It was
large and pleasantly yellow-walled, crowded with
projectors, view-booths, stereo-miniatures, and
picture books&mdash;all the visual aids which Ann
Howard would have used to teach the natives the
cultural philosophy of the Galactic Federation.
But the rows of seats were empty, and the gleaming
machines still stood in their cases. For no one
had come to Ann&rsquo;s school, in spite of her
extravagant offers of trade goods.</p>

<p>Ann sat waiting, ramrod straight, in front of a
green-tinged projectoscope. She made no compromise
with the heat, which had driven the men to strip
to their fatigue shorts. Ann wore the full, formal
uniform. A less strong-willed woman might have
appeared wilted after a day&rsquo;s work.
Ann&rsquo;s face was expressionless, a block of
cold ivory.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Page&nbsp;9]</a></span>

Only a faint mist of perspiration on
her upper lip betrayed her acute discomfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came promptly, Mr. Lord.&rdquo; There
was a faint gleam of triumph in her eyes.
&ldquo;That was good of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She unfolded her brother&rsquo;s note and gave it
to Lord. It was a clear, straight-forward
statement of fact. Don Howard said he was
deserting the mission, relinquishing his
Federation citizenship. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying
on this world; these people have something
priceless, Ann. All my life I&rsquo;ve been
looking for it, dreaming of it. You wouldn&rsquo;t
understand how I feel, but nothing else&mdash;nothing
else&mdash;matters, Ann. Go home. Leave these people
alone. Don&rsquo;t try to make them over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last lines rang in sympathy with Lord&rsquo;s
own feelings, and he knew that was absurd. Changes
would have to be made when the trade city was
built. That was Lord&rsquo;s business. Expansion
and progress: the lifeblood of the Federation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go after Don and bring him back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he refuses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave him here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no authority to force him against
his will, Ann.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can get help from
this&mdash;&rdquo;<a id="tn2_15" name="tn2_15"></a>
her lip curled &ldquo;&mdash;this native
girl of yours. What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Niaga.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; Niaga. Quaint, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; She smiled flatly.</p>

<p>He felt an almost irresistible urge to smash his
fist into her jaw. Straight-laced, hopelessly
blind to every standard but her own&mdash;what right
did Ann have to pass judgment on Niaga? It was a
rhetorical question. Ann Howard represented the
Federation no less than Lord did himself. By law,
the teachers rode every trading ship; in the final
analysis, their certification could make or break
any new planetary franchise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;Niaga has been very helpful, Ann;
cooperative and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure she has, Mr.
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could threaten to cut off Don&rsquo;s
bonus pay, I suppose, but it wouldn&rsquo;t do
much good;<a id="tn2_1" name="tn2_1"></a>
money has no meaning to these people
and, if Don intends to stay here, it won&rsquo;t
mean much to him, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you do it, Mr. Lord, is not my concern.
But if Don doesn&rsquo;t go home with us&mdash;&rdquo;
She favored him with another icy smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to make an
adverse report when you apply for the
franchise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Ann!&rdquo; Lord was more
surprised than angry. &ldquo;Only in the case of a
primitive and belligerent culture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen no evidence of technology
here.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;And not the
slightest indication that these people have any
conception of moral values.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by our standards, no; but we&rsquo;ve
never abandoned a planet for that reason
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Page&nbsp;10]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, Mr.
Lord. Men like you&mdash;the traders and the
businessmen and the builders&mdash;you&rsquo;ve never
understood a teacher&rsquo;s responsibility. You
make the big noise in the Federation; but we hold
it together for you. I&rsquo;m not particularly
disturbed by the superficials I&rsquo;ve seen
here. The indecent dress of these people, their
indolent villages, their congenital
irresponsibility&mdash;all that disgusts me, but it has
not affected my analysis. There&rsquo;s something
else here&mdash;something far more terrible and more
dangerous for us. I can&rsquo;t put it in words.
It&rsquo;s horrible and it&rsquo;s deadly;
it&rsquo;s the reason why our men have deserted.
They&rsquo;ve had attractive women on other
worlds&mdash;in the trade cities, anything money could
buy&mdash;but they never jumped ship before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A certain percentage always will,
Ann.&rdquo; Lord hoped he sounded reassuring, but
he felt anything but reassured himself. Not
because of what she said. These naive, altogether
delightful people were harmless. But could the
charming simplicity of their lives survive the
impact of civilization? It was this world that was
in danger, not by any stretch of the imagination
the Federation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the thought occurred to him, he shrank from it
with a kind of inner terror. It was heresy. The
Federation represented the closest approximation
of perfection mortal man would ever know: a
brotherhood of countless species, a union of a
thousand planets, created by the ingenuity and the
energy of man. The Pax Humana; how could it be a
threat to any people anywhere?</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be my recommendation.&rdquo;
Suddenly Ann&rsquo;s self-assurance collapsed. She
reached for his hand; her fingers were cold and
trembling. &ldquo;But, if you bring Don back, I&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t report against a franchise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re offering to make a deal? You
know the penalty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Collusion between a trade agent and the
teacher assigned to his ship&mdash;yes, I know the law,
Mr. Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re willing to violate it for Don?
Why? Your brother&rsquo;s a big boy now;
he&rsquo;s old enough to look after
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ann Howard turned away from him and her voice
dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t my
brother, Mr. Lord. We had to sign on that way
because your company prohibits a man and wife
sailing in the same crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In that moment she stripped her soul bare to him.
Poor, plain, conscientious Ann Howard! Fighting to
hold her man; fighting the unknown odds of an
alien world, the stealthy seduction of an amoral
people. Lord understood Ann, then, for the first
time; he saw the shadow of madness that crept
across her mind; and he pitied her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can,&rdquo; he
promised.</p>

<p>As he left the schoolroom she collapsed in a
straight-backed chair&mdash;thin and unattractive,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Page&nbsp;11]</a></span>

like Ann herself&mdash;and her shoulders shook with
silent, bitter grief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Martin Lord took the familiar path to
Niaga&rsquo;s village. The setting sun still
spread its dying fire across the evening sky, but
he walked slowly through the deep, quiet shadows
of the forest. He came to the stream where he had
met Niaga; he paused to dip his sweat-smeared face
into the cool water cascading over a five foot
fall.</p>

<p>A pleasant flood of memory crowded his mind. When
he had first met Niaga, almost a week before, she
had been lying on the sandy bank of the stream,
idly plaiting a garland of red and blue flowers.
Niaga! A copper-skinned goddess, stark naked and
unashamed in the bright spot light of sun filtered
through the trees. Languorous, laughing lips;
long, black hair loosely caught in a net of filmy
material that hung across her shoulder.</p>

<p>The feeling of guilt and shame had stabbed at
Lord&rsquo;s mind. He had come, unasked, into an
Eden. He didn&rsquo;t belong here. His presence
meant pillage, a rifling of a sacred dream. The
landing had been a mistake.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the <i>Ceres</i> had landed here entirely
by chance, the result of a boyish fling at
adventure.</p>

<p>Martin Lord was making a routine tour of
representative trade cities before assuming his
vice-presidency in the central office of Hamilton
Lord, Inc. It had been a family custom for
centuries, ever since the first domed ports had
been built on Mars and Venus.</p>

<p>Lord was twenty-six and, like all the family,
tall, slim, yellow-haired. As the Lords had for
generations, Martin had attended the Chicago
University of Commerce for four years, and the
Princeton Graduate School in Interstellar
Engineering four more&mdash;essential preparations for
the successful Federation trader. In Chicago
Martin had absorbed the basic philosophy of the
Federation: the union of planets and diverse
peoples, created by trade, was an economy
eternally prosperous and eternally growing,
because the number of undiscovered and unexploited
planets was infinite. The steady expansion of the
trade cities kept demand always one jump ahead of
supply; every merchant was assured that this
year&rsquo;s profits would always be larger than
last. It was the financial millennium, from which
depression and recession had been forever
eliminated. At Princeton Lord had learned the
practical physics necessary for building,
servicing and piloting the standard interstellar
merchant ships.</p>

<p>Martin Lord&rsquo;s tour of the trade cities
completed his education. It was his first actual
contact with reality. The economy of progress,
which had seemed so clear-cut in the Chicago
lecture halls, was translated into a brawling,
vice-ridden, frontier city. In the older trade
cities, the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Page&nbsp;12]</a></span>

culture of man had come to dominate
the occupied worlds. No trace of what alien
peoples had been or had believed survived, except
as museum oddities.</p>

<p>This, Lord admitted to himself, was conquest, by
whatever innocuous name it passed. But was it for
good or evil? In the first shock of reality,
Martin Lord had doubted himself and the destiny of
the Federation. But only for a moment. What he saw
was good&mdash;he had been taught to believe
that&mdash;because the Federation was perfection.</p>

<p>But the doubt, like a cancer, fed and grew in the
darkness of Lord&rsquo;s soul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the home trip a mechanical defect of the
calibration of the time-power carried the <i>Ceres</i>
off its course, light years beyond the segment of
the Galaxy occupied by the Federation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve burned out a relay,&rdquo; Don
Howard reported.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have we replacements?&rdquo; Lord asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no problem to fix. But repairs
would be easier if we could set the ship down
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord glanced at the unknown sun and three
satellite planets which were plotted
electronically on his cabin scanning screen. His
pulse leaped with sudden excitement. This was his
first&mdash;and last&mdash;chance for adventure, the only
interstellar flight he would command in his
lifetime. When he returned to earth, he would be
chained for the rest of his days to a desk job,
submerged in a sea of statistical tables and
financial statements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run an atmosphere analysis on those three
worlds, Mr. Howard,&rdquo; he said softly.</p>

<p>Driven by its auxiliary nuclear power unit, the
ship moved closer to the new solar system. In half
an hour Don Howard brought Lord the lab report.
Two of the planets were enveloped in methane, but
the third had an earth-normal atmosphere. Lord
gave the order for a landing, his voice pulsing
with poorly concealed, boyish pleasure.</p>

<p>The <i>Ceres</i> settled on a hilltop, its cushioning
rockets burning an improvised landing area in the
lush foliage. As the airlock swung open, Lord saw
half a dozen golden-skinned savages standing on
the edge of the clearing. As nearly as he could
judge, they were men; but that was not too
surprising, because a number of planets in the
Federation had evolved sentient species which
resembled man. The savages were unarmed and nearly
naked&mdash;tall, powerfully built men; they seemed
neither awed nor frightened by the ship.</p>

<p>Over the circle of scorched earth Lord heard the
sound of their voices. For a fleeting second the
words seemed to make sense&mdash;a clear, unmistakable
welcome to the new world.</p>

<p>But communication was inconceivable. This planet
was far beyond the fringe of the Federation. Lord
was letting his imagination run away with him.</p>

<p>He flung out his arms in a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Page&nbsp;13]</a></span>

universally accepted gesture of open-handed friendship.
At once the talk of the natives ceased. They stood
waiting silently on the burned ground while the men
unwound the landing ladder.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lord made the initial contact himself. The
techniques which he had learned in the University
of Commerce proved enormously successful. Within
ten minutes rapport was established; in twenty the
natives had agreed to submit to the linguistic
machines. Lord had read accounts of other
trailblazing commercial expeditions; and he knew
he was establishing a record for speed of
negotiation.</p>

<p>The savages were quite unfrightened as the
electrodes were fastened to their skulls, entirely
undisturbed by the whir of the machine. In less
than an hour they were able to use the common
language of the Federation. Another record; most
species needed a week&rsquo;s indoctrination.</p>

<p>Every new development suggested that these
half-naked primitives&mdash;with no machine
civilization, no cities, no form of space
flight&mdash;had an intellectual potential superior to
man&rsquo;s. The first question asked by one of
the broad-shouldered savages underscored that
conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come to our world as
colonists?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No mumbo-jumbo of superstition, no awe of
strangers who had suddenly descended upon them
from the sky.<a id="tn2_16" name="tn2_16"></a>
Lord answered, &ldquo;We landed in
order to repair our ship, but I hope we can make a
trade treaty with your government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment the six men consulted among
themselves with a silent exchange of glances. Then
one of them smiled and said, &ldquo;You must visit
our villages and explain the idea of trade to our
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Lord agreed. &ldquo;If
you could serve as interpreters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our people can learn your language as
rapidly as we have, if we can borrow your language
machine for a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord frowned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rather complex
device, and I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;you see, if
something went wrong, you might do a great deal of
harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would use it just as you did; we saw
everything you turned to make it run.&rdquo; One
of the golden-skinned primitives made a
demonstration, turning the console of dials with
the ease and familiarity of a semantic expert.
Again Lord was impressed by their
intelligence&mdash;and vaguely frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could call this the first trade
exchange between your world and ours,&rdquo;
another savage added. &ldquo;Give us the machine;
we&rsquo;ll send you fresh food from the
village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The argument was logical and eventually the
natives had their way. Perhaps it was Ann
Howard&rsquo;s intervention that decided the
point. She vehemently disapproved; a gift of
techniques

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Page&nbsp;14]</a></span>

should be withheld until she had
examined their cultural traditions. But Martin
Lord was a trade agent, and he had no intention of
allowing his mission to be wrecked by the
ephemeral doubts of a teacher. Here at the onset
was the time to make it clear that he was in
command. He gave the natives the machine.</p>

<p>As the six men trudged across the burned earth
carrying the heavy apparatus easily on their
shoulders, Lord wondered if either he or Ann
Howard had much to do with the negotiations. He
had an unpleasant feeling that, from the very
beginning, the natives had been in complete
control of the situation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Less than an hour after the six men had departed,
a band of natives emerged from the forest bearing
gifts of food&mdash;straw baskets heaped with fruit,
fresh meat wrapped in grass mats, hampers of
bread, enormous pottery jars filled with a sweet,
cold, milky liquid. Something very close to the
miraculous had occurred. Every native had learned
to use the Federation language.</p>

<p>A kind of fiesta began in the clearing beside the
<i>Ceres</i>. The natives built fires to cook the food.
The women, scantily dressed if they were clothed
at all, danced sensuously in the bright sunlight
to a peculiarly exotic, minor-keyed music played
on reed and percussion instruments. Laughing
gaily, they enticed members of Lord&rsquo;s crew
to join them.</p>

<p>The milky drink proved mildly intoxicating&mdash;yet
different from the stimulants used in the
Federation. Lord drank a long draught from a mug
brought him by one of the women. The effect was
immediate. He felt no dulling of his reason,
however; no loss of muscular control, but instead
a stealthy relaxation of mental strain joined with
a satisfying sense of physical well-being. A
subtle shifting in prospective, in accepted
values.</p>

<p>The savage feast, which grew steadily more
boisterous, Lord would have called an orgy under
other circumstances. The word did occur to him,
but it seemed fantastically inapplicable. Normally
the behavior of his men would have demanded the
severest kind of disciplinary action. But here the
old code of rules simply didn&rsquo;t apply and he
didn&rsquo;t interfere with their enjoyment.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun blazed in the western sky; heat
in shimmering waves hung over the clearing. Lord
went into the ship and stripped off his uniform;
somehow the glittering insignia, the ornamental
braid, the stiff collar&mdash;designed to be impressive
symbols of authority&mdash;seemed garish and out of
place. Lord put on the shorts which he wore when
he exercised in the capsule gym aboard ship.</p>

<p>Outside again, he found that most of the men had
done the same thing. The sun felt warm on his
skin; the air was comfortably balmy, entirely free
of the swarms of flies and other insects

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Page&nbsp;15]</a></span>

which made other newly contacted frontier worlds so
rugged.</p>

<p>As he stood in the shelter of the landing ladder
and sipped a second mug of the white liquor, Lord
became slowly aware of something else. Divested of
their distinguishing uniforms, he and his crew
seemed puny and ill-fed beside the natives. If
physique were any index to the sophistication of a
culture&mdash;but that was a ridiculous generalization!</p>

<p>He saw Ann Howard coming toward him through the
crowd&mdash;stern-faced, hard-jawed, stiffly dignified
in her uniform. The other women among the crew had
put on their lightest dress, but not Ann. Lord was
in no frame of mind, just then, to endure an
interview with her. He knew precisely what she
would say; Ann was a kind of walking encyclopedia
of the conventions.</p>

<p>Lord slid out of sight in the shadow of the ship,
but Ann had seen him. He turned blindly into the
forest, running along the path toward the village.</p>

<p>In a fern-banked glen beside the miniature
waterfall he had met Niaga.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No woman he had ever known seemed so
breathtakingly beautiful. Her skin had been
caressed by a lifetime&rsquo;s freedom in the sun;
her long, dark hair had the sheen of polished
ebony; and in the firm, healthy curves of her body
he saw the sensuous grace of a Venus or an
Aphrodite.</p>

</div><div class="figcenter"><a id="illo" name="illo"></a>

<p class="center caption">In a fern-banked glen beside a
miniature waterfall, Martin Lord first saw Niaga.</p>
</div><div class="mainbody">

<p>She stood up slowly and faced him, smiling; a
bright shaft of sunlight fell on the liquid bow of
her lips. &ldquo;I am Niaga,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You must be one of the men who came on the
ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martin Lord,&rdquo; he answered huskily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the trade agent in
command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am honored.&rdquo; Impulsively she took
the garland of flowers which she had been making
and put it around his neck. When she came close,
the subtle perfume of her hair was
unmistakable&mdash;like the smell of pine needles on a
mountain trail; new grass during a spring rain; or
the crisp, winter air after a fall of snow.
Perfume sharply symbolic of freedom, heady and
intoxicating, numbing his mind with the ghosts of
half-remembered dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was coming to your ship with the
others,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I stopped here
to swim, as I often do. I&rsquo;m afraid I stayed
too long, day-dreaming on the bank; time means so
little to us.&rdquo; Shyly she put her hand in
his. &ldquo;But, perhaps, no harm is done, since
you are still alone. If you have taken no one
else, will I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are strangers; we want you to feel
welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Niaga, people don&rsquo;t&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo;
He floundered badly. Intellectually he knew he
could not apply the code of his culture to hers;
emotionally it was a difficult concept to accept.
If his standards were invalid, his definitions
might be, too. Perhaps this society was no more
primitive than&mdash;No! A mature people

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Page&nbsp;16]</a></span>

would always develop more or less the same mechanical
techniques, and these people had nothing remotely
like a machine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent us a gift,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It is only proper for us to return the
kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have made a rather miraculous use of
the language machine in a remarkably short period
of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We applied it to everyone in the village.
We knew it would help your people feel at ease, if
we could talk together in a common tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go to great pains to welcome a shipload
of strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally. Consideration for others is the
first law of humanity.&rdquo; After a pause, she
added very slowly, with her eyes fixed on his,
&ldquo;Mr. Lord, do you plan to make a colony
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eventually. After we repair the ship, I
hope to negotiate a trade treaty with your
government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t intend to stay here
yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have we failed in our welcome? Is there
something more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Niaga, nothing like that. I find your
world very&mdash;very beautiful.&rdquo; The word very
inadequately expressed what he really felt.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not free to make the
choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew in her breath sharply. &ldquo;Your
people, then, hold you enslaved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed&mdash;uneasily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home
to manage Hamilton Lord; it&rsquo;s the largest
trading company in the Federation. We have
exclusive franchises to develop almost five
hundred planets. It&rsquo;s my duty, Niaga; my
responsibility; I can&rsquo;t shirk it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not&mdash;if you wanted to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m Martin Lord; because
I&rsquo;ve been trained&mdash;No, it&rsquo;s something
I can&rsquo;t explain. You&rsquo;ll just have to
take my word for it. Now tell me: how should I go
about negotiating a treaty with your
people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke of the government, Martin Lord; I
suppose you used the word in a symbolic
sense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your chieftain; your tribal
leader&mdash;whatever name you have for them.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Her big, dark eyes widened in surprise.
&ldquo;Then you meant actual men? It&rsquo;s a
rather unusual use of the word, isn&rsquo;t it?
For us, government is a synonym for law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, but you must have leaders to
interpret it and enforce it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enforce a law?&rdquo; This seemed to amuse
her.<a id="tn2_2" name="tn2_2"></a>
&ldquo;How? A law is a statement of a truth
in human relationship; it doesn&rsquo;t have to be
enforced. What sane person would violate a truth?
What would you do, Martin Lord, if I told you we
had no government, in your sense of the
word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be that primitive,
Niaga!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it be so terribly wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Page&nbsp;17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s anarchy. There&rsquo;d be no
question, then, of granting us a trade franchise;
we&rsquo;d have to set up a trusteeship and let
the teachers run your planet until you had learned
the basic processes of social organization.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niaga turned away from him, her hands twisted
together. She said, in a soft whisper that was
flat and emotionless, &ldquo;We have a council of
elders, Martin Lord. You can make your treaty with
them.&rdquo; Then, imperceptibly, her voice
brightened. &ldquo;It will take a week or more to
bring the council together. And that is all to the
good; it will give your people time to visit in
our villages and to get better acquainted with
us.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Niaga left him, then; she said she would go to the
village and send out the summons for the council.
By a roundabout path, Lord returned to the
clearing around the <i>Ceres</i>. The forest fascinated
him. It was obviously cultivated like a park, and
he was puzzled that a primitive society should
practice such full scale conservation. Normally
savages took nature for granted or warred against
it.</p>

<p>He came upon a brown gash torn in a hillside above
the stream, a place where natives were apparently
working to build up the bank against erosion. In
contrast to the beauty that surrounded it, the
bare earth was indescribably ugly, like a livid
scar in a woman&rsquo;s face. In his mind Lord saw
this scar multiplied a thousand times&mdash;no, a
million times&mdash;when the machines of the galaxy
came to rip out resources for the trade cities. He
envisioned the trade cities that would rise
against the horizon, the clutter of suburban
subdivisions choking out the forests; he saw the
pall of industrial smoke that would soil the clean
air, the great machines clattering over asphalt
streets.</p>

<p>For the first time he stated the problem honestly,
to himself: this world must be saved exactly as it
was. But how? How could Lord continue to represent
Hamilton Lord, Inc., as a reputable trade agent,
and at the same time save Niaga&rsquo;s people
from the impact of civilization?</p>

<p>It was sunset when he returned to the <i>Ceres</i>. On
the clearing the festivities were still going on,
but at a slower pace. Ann Howard was waiting for
Lord at the door of his cabin. She registered her
official disapproval of the revelry, which Lord
had expected, and then she added,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make a treaty with them;
these people have no government with the authority
to deal with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, Ann; there&rsquo;s a
council of elders&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Page&nbsp;18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg to differ, Mr. Lord.&rdquo; Her lips
made a flat, grim line against her teeth.
&ldquo;This afternoon I made a point of talking to
every native in the clearing. Their idea of
government is something they call the law of
humanity. Whether it is written down or not, I
have no way of knowing; but certainly they have no
such thing as a central authority. This rather
indicates a teacher trusteeship for the planet, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a mistake, Ann;
I&rsquo;ll have to check for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord and Ann Howard moved together through the
clearing and he began to talk to the natives. In
each case he elicited the same information that
Ann had given him. The mention of a governing
council seemed to amuse the savages. Lord and Ann
were still conducting their puzzling inquest when
Niaga returned from the village. She said that the
council had been called and would meet within a
week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There seems to be some difference of
opinion,&rdquo; Ann told her coldly,
&ldquo;between you and your people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lord added uncertainly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asking about the council
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t phrase your question
clearly,&rdquo; Niaga put in smoothly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not quite used to using your
words yet with your definitions.&rdquo; To make
her point, she called the same natives whom Ann
and Lord had questioned, and this time, without
exception, they reversed their testimony. Lord was
willing to believe the language had caused the
difficulty. Niaga&rsquo;s people were entirely
incapable of deception; what reason would they
have had?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From that hour, the clearing was never altogether
free of native guests. They deluged Lord&rsquo;s
crew with kindness and entertainment. Lord never
left the ship, day or night, without having Niaga
slip up beside him and put her arm through his.
Because Ann Howard had made her objections so
clear, the native women, in an effort to please
the teacher, had taken to wearing more clothing
than they were accustomed to. But they rejected
the sack-like plastics which Ann dispensed in the
schoolroom and put on the mist-like,
pastel-colored netting which they used normally to
decorate their homes. If anything, the addition of
clothing made the women more attractive than ever.</p>

<p>The scientists among Lord&rsquo;s men analyzed the
planetary resources and found the planet
unbelievably rich in metals; the botanists
determined that the seeds for the exotic fruits
and flowers were exportable. All told,
Niaga&rsquo;s world could develop into the richest
franchise in the Federation.</p>

<p>Niaga took Lord to visit the villages which were
close to the landing site. Each town was exactly
like its neighbors, a tiny cluster of small,
yellow-walled, flat-roofed houses nestled among
the tall trees close to a cleared farmland which
was worked co-operatively by everyone in the
village. No single town was large, yet judging
from the number that he saw, Lord estimated the
planetary population in the billions.</p>

<p>Continuously Niaga tried to persuade him to stay
and build a colony in the new world. Lord

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Page&nbsp;19]</a></span>

knew that the other natives were being as persuasive
with the rest of the crew. And the temptation was
very real: to trade the energetic, competitive,
exhausting routine that he knew for the quiet
peace and relaxation here.</p>

<p>As the days passed the rigid scheduling of
exploratory activities, always practiced by a
trade mission, began to break down. The charming
savages of this new world put no monetary value on
time, and something of their spirit began to
infect Lord&rsquo;s crew. They stopped bucking for
overtime; most of them applied for accumulated
sick leave&mdash;so they could walk in the forest with
the native women, or swim in the forest pools.
Even Lord found time to relax.</p>

<p>One afternoon, after a swim with Niaga, they lay
in the warm sun on the grassy bank of a stream.
Niaga picked a blue, delicately scented water
lily, and gently worked it into his hair. Slowly
she bent her face close until her lips brushed his
cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must you really go away when the treaty is
made?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Lord, Niaga.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that matter? If you like it
here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Niaga, I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged
his shoulders helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is it so important for you to build
your trade cities?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he sought for words to answer her question, the
spell of her presence was broken. He saw her for
what she was: an extremely beautiful woman,
sensuously very lovely, yet nonetheless a
primitive&mdash;a forlorn child without any conception
of the meaning of civilization. &ldquo;We keep our
union of planets economically sound,&rdquo; he
explained patiently, &ldquo;and at peace by
constantly expanding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have visited the schoolroom your teacher
has put up beside the ship. I have seen her models
of the many machines your people know how to
build. But why do you do it, Martin Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The machines make our lives easier and more
comfortable; they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More comfortable than this?&rdquo; She
gestured toward the stream and the cultivated
forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your world moves at the pace of a walk,
Niaga; with our machines, you could rise above
your trees, reach your destination in
minutes&mdash;when now it takes you days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And miss all the beauty on the way. What
point is there in saving time, and losing so much
that really matters? Do your machines give you
anything&mdash;you as a person, Martin Lord&mdash;that you
couldn&rsquo;t have here without them?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question was unanswerable. It symbolized the
enormous gulf that lay between Niaga and himself.
More than that, Lord saw clearly that the trade
cities would destroy her world utterly. Neither
Niaga nor her way of life could survive the impact
of civilization. And the exotic charm, the
friendly innocence

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Page&nbsp;20]</a></span>

was worth saving. Somehow Lord had to find a way to do it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lord was by no means surprised when the first
three men jumped ship and went to live in one of
the quiet villages. Subconsciously he envied them;
subconsciously he wished he had the courage to
make the same decision. Although Ann Howard
demanded it, Lord couldn&rsquo;t seriously
consider taking measures to stop further
desertions.</p>

<p>When Don Howard jumped ship, he brought the issue
to a head. Ann maneuvered Lord so that he would
have to take a stand. What and how, he
didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>It was the first time since the landing that Niaga
had not been waiting outside the ship for Lord. At
his request she had gone to the village to find
what progress had been made in calling the council
of elders. Lord knew where to find her, but after
his talk with Ann he walked slowly along the
forest path. He stopped to dip his face into the
stream where he had first met Niaga. Anything to
put off the showdown. Lord was trying desperately
to understand and evaluate his own motivation.</p>

<p>He accepted the fact that he had not stopped the
desertions because, if enough men jumped ship, the
<i>Ceres</i> would be unable to take off again. Lord
could then have embraced Niaga&rsquo;s temptation
without having to make the decision for himself.
But that was a coward&rsquo;s way out and no
solution. There would always be people like Ann
Howard who would not accept the situation. They
would eventually make radio communication with the
Federation, and the location of Niaga&rsquo;s
world would no longer be a secret.</p>

<p>Fundamentally that was the only thing that
counted: to preserve this world from the impact of
civilization.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, as he listened to the music of the
stream, Lord saw how that could be done. Ann
Howard had offered him a deal; she would keep her
word. Everything hinged on that.</p>

<p>Don Howard had to be brought back&mdash;if persuasion
failed, then by force.</p>

<p>Martin Lord ran back to the clearing. From a
supply shed he took a pair of deadly atomic
pistols. Their invisible, pin-point knife of
exploding energy could slice through eighteen feet
of steel, transform a mountain into a cloud of
radioactive dust.</p>

<p>He ran through the forest to the village. As
usual, the children were playing games on the
grass, while the adults lounged in front of their
dwellings or enjoyed community singing and dancing
to the pulsing rhythm of their music. The sound of
gaiety suddenly died as Lord walked between the
rows of houses.</p>

<p>Strange, he thought; they seemed to guess what was
in his mind. Niaga ran from the quiet crowd and
took his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Martin Lord; you must not
interfere!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Page&nbsp;21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Howard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a free man; he has a right to
choose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take him back.&rdquo; He
drew one of his guns. She looked at him steadily,
without fear, and she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made you welcome; we have given you our
friendship, and now you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pushed her aside brutally because her
gentleness, her lack of anger, tightened the
constriction of his own sense of guilt. Lord fired
his weapon at the trunk of a tree. The wood flamed
red for a moment and the sound of the explosion
rocked the air, powdering the grass with black
ash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the kind of power controlled by
men,&rdquo; he said. His voice was harsh, shrill
with shame and disgust for the role he had to
play. &ldquo;I shall use this weapon to destroy
your homes&mdash;each of them, one by one&mdash;unless you
surrender Don Howard to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he turned the pistol slowly toward the closest
yellow wall, Niaga whispered, &ldquo;Violence is a
violation of the law of humanity. We offered Don
Howard sanctuary and peace&mdash;as we offer it to all
of you. Stay with us, Martin Lord; make your home
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He clenched his jaw. &ldquo;I want Don and I want
him now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why must you go back? Your world is
powerful; your world is enormous with cities and
machines. But what does it hold for you as a man,
Martin Lord? Here we give you the dreams of your
own soul, peace and beauty, laughter and
dignity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surrender, Don!&rdquo; Although he was
vaguely aware of it, he had no time to consider
consciously the strangely sophisticated wording of
her argument. When she continued to talk in the
same gentle voice, the temptation caressed his
mind like a narcotic; against his will, the
tension began to wash from his muscles. Driven by
a kind of madness to escape the sound of her
voice, he pulled the trigger. The yellow wall
exploded. Concussion throbbed in his ears,
deafening him&mdash;but he still heard her whisper in
the depths of his soul, like the music of a forest
stream.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then, at the end of the village street, he saw Don
Howard coming out of one of the houses with his
hands held high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You win, Lord; leave them alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was victory, but Lord felt no triumph&mdash;only a
crushing bitterness. He motioned Howard to take
the path back to the ship. To Niaga he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your council of elders ever gets around
to meeting, you might tell them that, as far as
I&rsquo;m concerned, you&rsquo;ve already signed
the trade treaty with me. We&rsquo;re leaving in
the morning to register the franchise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d break your own law? You said
the negotiations had to be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Page&nbsp;22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Our men will come shortly to build the
first trade city. I advise you not to resist them;
they&rsquo;ll be armed with guns more powerful
than mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reached for his hand, but Lord turned away
from her quickly so that she could not again open
the raw wound of shame in his soul. He followed
Don Howard into the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get away with it,
Lord,&rdquo; Howard said grimly. &ldquo;No trade
agent can impose a treaty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would a trusteeship be any better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only two alternatives, and a
Hamilton Lord trade city is by far the
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;for Hamilton Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, for these people. Don&rsquo;t forget,
I&rsquo;ll be running Hamilton Lord. The exclusive
franchise will keep out the other traders, and I
can see to it that our trade city does no harm.
We&rsquo;ve a thousand planets in the Federation;
who&rsquo;s going to know if one of the cities
doesn&rsquo;t really function?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I get it. But why the hell did you have to
bring me back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make a deal with&mdash;with your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a long pause, Don Howard said wearily,
&ldquo;If Hamilton Lord can sacrifice the richest
franchise in the galaxy, I suppose I can do my
bit, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At dawn the <i>Ceres</i> departed. Lord drove his men
to work throughout the night stowing the prefabs
and the trade goods aboard the ship. Just before
the power tubes stabbed the launching fire into
the earth, a delegation of villagers came into the
clearing. Niaga led them and she spoke to Lord at
the foot of the landing ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We still want you to stay among us, Martin
Lord; we have come again to offer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her arms around his neck and drew his lips
against hers. The temptation washed over his mind,
shattering his resolution and warping his reason.
This was what he wanted: the golden dream of every
man. But for Lord only one idea held fast.
Niaga&rsquo;s primitive, naive world had to be
preserved exactly as it was. If he gave in to the
dream, he would destroy it. Only in the central
office of Hamilton Lord could he do anything to
save what he had found here. He wrenched himself
free of her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Niaga.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew that she had lost, and she moved away
from him. One of the other golden-skinned savages
pushed a small, carved box into his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A parting gift,&rdquo; Niaga said.
&ldquo;Open it when you are aboard your ship,
Martin Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long after the <i>Ceres</i> had blasted off, he sat
alone in his cabin looking at the box&mdash;small,
delicately carved from a strange material, like a
soft plastic. It seemed somehow alive, throbbing
with the memory of the dream he had left behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Page&nbsp;23]</a></span></p>

<p>jWith a sigh he opened the box. A billow of white
dust came from it. The box fell apart and the
pieces, like disintegrating gelatine, began to
melt away. A printed card, made of the same
unstable material, lay in Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have three minutes, Martin Lord,&rdquo;
he read. &ldquo;The drug is painless, but before
it wipes memory from the minds of you and your
crew, I want you to understand why we felt it
necessary to do this to you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you first landed, we realized that you
came from a relatively immature culture because
you made no response to our telepathy of welcome.
We did our best after that to simplify your
adjustment to our way of life, because we knew you
would have to stay among us. Of course, we never
really learned your language; we simply gave you
the illusion that we had. Nor is there any such
thing as a council of elders; we had to invent
that to satisfy you. We truly wanted you to stay
among us. In time you could have grown up
enough&mdash;most of you&mdash;to live with us as equals. We
knew it would be disastrous for you to carry back
to your world your idea of how we live. We are the
tomorrow of your people; you must grow up to us.
There is no other way to maturity. We could not,
of course, keep you here against your will. Nor
could we let you go back, like a poison, into your
world. We could do nothing else but use this drug.
The impact of civilization upon a primitive people
like yours....&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words hazed and faded as the note
disintegrated. Lord felt a moment of desperate
yearning, a terrible weight of grief. With an
effort he pushed himself from his chair and pulled
open the door into the corridor. He had to order
the ship back while he could still remember; he
had to find Niaga and tell her ...</p>

<p>... tell her. Tell whom? Tell what? Lord stood in
the corridor staring blankly at the metal wall. He
was just a little puzzled as to why he was there,
what he had meant to do. He saw Ann Howard coming
toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the lurch in the ship, Mr.
Lord?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose I did.&rdquo; Was that why
he had left his cabin?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought we were having trouble with the
time-power calibration, but I checked with Don and
he says everything&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; She
glanced through the open door of his cabin at the
electronic pattern on the scanning screen.
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll be home in another twenty
hours, Mr. Lord. It&rsquo;s a pity we didn&rsquo;t
contact any new planets on this mission. It would
have been a good experience for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I rather hoped so, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went back to his desk. Strange, he
couldn&rsquo;t remember what it was he had wanted
to do. He shrugged his shoulders and laughed a
little to himself. It definitely wouldn&rsquo;t
do&mdash;not at all&mdash;for a Lord to have lapses of
memory.</p>
